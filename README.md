# Early-Aggression-Detection-Through-Pose-Extraction
This project creates a violence detection system using YOLOv8 pose estimation and Bi-LSTM deep learning to analyse biomechanical features for identifying violent activities in video sequences based on multi-person behaviours. The goal of this project is to achieve 80-90% accuracy on the RWF-2000 benchmark dataset.
